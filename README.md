# Edge_detector_hardware_accelerator

Designed and simulated a hardware accelerator in Verilog to perform real-time edge detection using the Sobel Operator. By Optimized the datapath by replacing multipliers with efficient bit-shifting logic to minimize hardware resource usage. Developed a Python-based co-simulation environment to convert real-world images into hex memory files and visually verify the processed output, confirming successful hardware logic execution.
